# Project2_CosmicCocktails
Mixology App using 3rd party TheCocktaildbapi, MVC Controllers, Passport, Nodejs, and Heroku.

# The Project:

**Cosmic Cocktails** 

Made as part of the Vanderbilt University coding bootcamp made by Adam Wolff, Codie Mitchell, Kathryn Lundy, and Sandy Smith. Cosmic Cocktails is a webapp that hooks into the Cocktail DB to give you drink suggestions based off the following criteria (a cocktail name, a letter or a even a number) to give you the best drink to entertain as well as bring out the **master mixologist** in you!

**The app allows a user to:**

- Search cocktails By Name or by a Letter or even by a number.
- Given a certain Cocktail, visualize: Picture, Description, Recipe (Ingredients & Instructions) and Glass Type.

**Need a drink recipe on the fly?  Looking for a new drink recipe?  Try our app....**

## DRINK SEARCH
1.  In the search bar, enter a specific drink name or a letter, or even a number, this will search the API and give you result(s) that matched your query.

2.  If you searched by a letter or a number, you will be given drink options.  Choose a specific drink from the list. *Do you like the recipe?* You can save it to Favorites, local DB allowing us to return you to it in the future.  

3.  In order to save to Favorites, you will need to first Register with the app and then Login. Once this step is completed, search the app for a drink, if you like the drink, save it to your Favorites. **BAM!** Your Favorites list is started!  This allows the DB to identify you and your Favorites when you return in the future.

## The App

*A picture is worth a thousand words...*
